# Containers

This directory contains Docker containers for various development and build tasks.

## Instructions

To use the containers in this directory, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. **Navigate to the container directory**: Open your terminal and change to the directory of the container you want to use. For example, for the `wasm-pack` container, navigate to `containers/wasm-pack`.
3. **Start the container**: Use Docker Compose to start the container. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the specific README file for each container (e.g., `containers/wasm-pack/README.md`) for any additional setup or configuration instructions.
